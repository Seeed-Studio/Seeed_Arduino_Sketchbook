# TinyML Course 6 Speech Recognition (TensorFlow Micro)

To run test on static data you will need sufficiently new version of Tensorflow Lite for Microcontrollers. Read on how to get it in [Seeed Wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-TinyML-TFLM-1/#install-the-arduino-tensorflow-lite-library).

To train your own model, have a look at [Speech-to-Intent-Micro](https://github.com/AIWintermuteAI/Speech-to-Intent-Micro) repository.
